# VMware Migration

## Important Notes
- Know what you are doing and test! Don't use this and mess something up. 

## Environment & Usage
This script was created to provide a relatively simple and automated method to migrate from an older VMware cluster to a new shiny VMware cluster that was just installed. We are moving from IBM hardware with fibre channel storage to a VMware cluster on Dell vSAN ready nodes managed by the SDDC suite. (https://www.vmware.com/solutions/software-defined-datacenter/in-depth.html) Specificaly the Virtual Cloud Foundataion suite - We were (unwittingly) the ~40th production installation of this suite of tools and have been very pleased.
